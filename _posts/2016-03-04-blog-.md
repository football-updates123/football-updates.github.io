Identity map

It made think about general life and what I would actually want to do when I am older and how to get there. It showed that people why I post the pictures I post as it is what I want to do when I am older. I used to think social media is just a group of websites where people go to catch up with their friends but it is much more than that. You can lose or get a job, which can affect how much money you get, which can affect how safe you are, so overall it can affect your life. I will be a little more careful for what I post as it can affect me or someone else.
