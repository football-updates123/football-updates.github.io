This lesson we got are microb:ts. Microb:ts are a computing device which lets you create games on them by creating your own games. The BBC were very kind of sending these really cool piece of tech so I would like to thank them. Also we looked at social media and the good side of it and the bad side. I learnt that social media can make you an internet sensation but not just for good reasons.
