This lesson

We were talking about what we have and don't do.  The teacher showed us some adverts like how MCdonalds burgers in adverts compared to the m in reality. There is a big difference. As well as how photoshop makes people look really handsome/pretty while in the real world they are ugly hens. to sum it up people in reality are not the same in the fake world.
