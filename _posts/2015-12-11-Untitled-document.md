**Lesson ?**

This lesson we changed the colour of our websites as you can see. We also change some wording to change the colour of the font.

This lesson I enjoyed experimenting which colours matched up with each other. I also enjoyed changing my avatar to a different one.

I don't really understand how to change the coding as sometimes the website dosen?t change to the new improved one.
