This lesson we talked about how the little things can turn into big things over just s few hours. It might affect people lives not just for a day but for a decade or all the lives. We were watching a video about how a brother and sister set out on who could get one million suscribers before the party. They started off by doing silly dances and challenges but then it got serious. There boyfriend/girlfriends were with them one filming his friend naked then to stand up for the boy a person filmed the other people having sex. Both videos went viral and they got tricked and bullied for what happend. If you don't feel ok on what is going to happen to you, you donâ€™t have you do it. Do not let other people ruin your life.
