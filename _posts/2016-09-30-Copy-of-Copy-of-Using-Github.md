    <td>Most of the lesson was just talking on how to setup the computer but then after that, I went with a partner and we read through the booklet to see what we were going to do for the lesson. After we setup the computer (which did have a few problems) we started coding what we was supposed to. It ended up saying hello.</td>

    <td>I need to try and look for different ways to answer the problem instead of expecting it to be wrong and going straight to the teacher. I also need to look for different ways to do something.</td>
