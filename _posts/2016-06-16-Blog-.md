**Blog ?**

This lesson we were starting building our games. At the start  the lesson we checked our homework to see if people have done it. After that we made our homework better by changing some fonts, size of writing. After people have done that we started making our games. I started to realise that me and my partner should have put more effort into the planning side of things as we realised there wasn't a variable that we needed. Overall the lesson went well even though I had some ups and downs.
