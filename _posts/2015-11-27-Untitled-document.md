1st lesson

This lesson was quite a good lesson for me as I understood nearly everything. I don't know how to change the theme of the page but I don?t really mind having the same page as I started with. I am happy with myself because most of the time I was one of the 5 people back to the front. I learnt not to play hockey with Mr Keen and not to have a competition with him for who can throw the ball the fastest.
